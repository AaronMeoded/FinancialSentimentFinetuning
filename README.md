# Financial Sentiment Analysis with Fine-Tuned FinBERT LLM
### Overview
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the FinBERT Large Language Model (LLM) for sentiment analysis on financial texts. Leveraging Hugging Face Transformers, the model achieves 93% test accuracy, making it a robust foundation for building a Generative AI-based investment strategy application.

### Features
- Fine-tuned FinBERT, a specialized NLP model for financial domain tasks.
- Enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities tailored to financial texts (e.g., earnings reports, news articles, and analyst opinions).
- High accuracy (93% on the test set), ensuring reliable insights for financial decision-making.

### Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- FinBERT (a financial domain-specific BERT model)

### Results
